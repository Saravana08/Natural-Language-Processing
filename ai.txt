Machine learning is application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and learn.

Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.

R,Java, Python, Lisp, Prolog, and C++ are major AI programming language used for artificial intelligence capable of satisfying different needs in the development and designing of different software.

R is a language used for statistical computations, data analysis and graphical representation of data.

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

Python is general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries. Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Python is a great tool for machine learning or deep learning.

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed, else you can download the anaconda navigator from https://www.anaconda.com/ and start using python language.
